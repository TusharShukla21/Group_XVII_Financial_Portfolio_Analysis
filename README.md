# Objective
  The objective of this project is to analyze stock market data to evaluate the risk (standard deviation) and return (mean) of stocks over time.The analysis provides insights into the relationship      between risk and return, helping to make informed investment decisions.

# Programming Language: Python
# Libraries:
  pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  matplotlib: For visualizing data.

# Data Source
  Historical stock market data was downloaded from Kaggle and stored in an Excel file named yahoo_data.xlsx.

# Execution Steps
  1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
  2. Place the yahoo_data.xlsx file in the project directory.
  3. Run the Python script
  4. The script will:
        Read the stock market data from the Excel file.
        Calculate daily returns, risk, and return for the specified periods.
        Generate and display visualizations (scatter, line, or bar graphs).
# Summary
  1. A Bar Graph illustrated the annualized risk and return for different years.
  2. The results demonstrated that higher risks are often associated with higher returns, but there were periods of significant deviation from this trend.
# Challenges Faced
  1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  2. Adjusting graph scales for small variations in risk and return.
  3. Differentiating trends in overlapping data points in scatter and line plots.
